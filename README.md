# Tim Creamer Prayer Room

## todo

- submit a prayer

  - button could be more responsive to what's happening

- pattern not rendering correctly?

## future ideas

- limit the amount that can be clicked?
- marking a prayer as answered?

- OAuth with ChurchSuite
  - then prefill or one click sign up
  - public/private prayers
  - notification over email when someone prays for you.
- Masonary Grid for the inspiration page (or just CSS grid with variable height)
