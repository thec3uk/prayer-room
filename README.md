# Tim Creamer Prayer Room

## todo

- pattern not rendering correctly?
- sort meetings by date = needs to be in JS

## future ideas

- limit the amount that can be clicked?
- marking a prayer as answered? - replace forms with airtable?

- OAuth with ChurchSuite
  - then prefill or one click sign up
  - public/private prayers
  - notification over email when someone prays for you.
- Masonary Grid for the inspiration page (or just CSS grid with variable height)
